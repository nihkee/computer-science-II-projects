Computer Science II

Description:

This course continues the studentâ€™s development of programming and problem-solving skills by providing an introduction to object-oriented design and programming (OOP). The primary focus is on OOP principles and techniques, including encapsulation, aggregation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Other OOP topics such as exception handling and templates are also covered. This is the second course for students interested in pursuing further study in computer science.

Course Outcomes:

1. Understand the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how they apply to C++ programming, including the concepts of classes and objects.

2. Learn to design and implement classes and objects in C++, using proper encapsulation, data abstraction, and information hiding techniques.

3. Master the use of pointers in C++ to effectively manipulate memory and dynamically allocate and deallocate objects.

4. Develop proficiency in creating and manipulating linked lists, including operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

5. Explore the concept of inheritance and its role in creating hierarchical relationships between classes, enabling code reuse and extensibility.

6. Gain proficiency in implementing inheritance and understanding the various types of inheritance in C++, such as single inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

7. Understand and apply the concept of polymorphism in C++, including function overloading and virtual functions, to write flexible and extensible code that can handle different object types efficiently.

8. Learn to utilize C++ templates to write generic code that can work with multiple data types, improving code reusability and reducing redundancy.

9. Develop skills in writing effective unit tests for C++ programs, using testing frameworks and techniques to ensure code correctness, reliability, and maintainability.
